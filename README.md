## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Supabase database

This backend connects to Supabase PostgreSQL through MikroORM. Copy the environment
template and replace the placeholder values with the URI from Supabase Dashboard >
Connect > Connection string:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to the Supabase URI. The URI must include
`?sslmode=require`, for example:

```text
postgresql://postgres.[project-ref]:[password]@[region].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require
```

Use the session pooler URI for server deployments. Keep `.env` private; it is
excluded from version control.

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

The following commands deploy the API on an Ubuntu VPS using systemd. They assume
the project is copied to `/var/www/dairy-backend`, the VPS uses a `dairy` Linux
user, and PostgreSQL is hosted by Supabase.

```bash
sudo useradd --system --home /var/www/dairy-backend --shell /usr/sbin/nologin dairy
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/dairy-backend /etc/dairy-backend
sudo chown -R dairy:dairy /var/www/dairy-backend
cd /var/www/dairy-backend
git clone https://github.com/yashpatoliya14/dairy-backend.git .
npm ci
npm run build
```

Create `/etc/dairy-backend/dairy-backend.env` with your real database URL and a
long random JWT secret:

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.PROJECT_REF:PASSWORD@REGION.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN_SECONDS=604800
```

Then apply the schema and start the included systemd service:

```bash
sudo -u dairy npm run db:schema:update -- --run
sudo cp deploy/dairy-backend.service /etc/systemd/system/dairy-backend.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now dairy-backend
sudo systemctl status dairy-backend
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

Use `sudo journalctl -u dairy-backend -f` for logs and
`sudo systemctl restart dairy-backend` after deployments. Put Nginx or Caddy in
front of the service for HTTPS, then set Flutter's `API_BASE_URL` to the HTTPS
API URL.

### Optional Render keep-alive service

If this VPS should ping the Render deployment every five minutes, install the
included systemd service:

```bash
cp deploy/render-keepalive.service /etc/systemd/system/render-keepalive.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now render-keepalive.service
systemctl status render-keepalive.service
```

The service runs `deploy/render-keepalive.js`, which immediately requests
`https://dairy-backend-eemp.onrender.com/` and repeats every five minutes. If
Node is installed at a different path, update `ExecStart` with the result of
`readlink -f "$(command -v node)"`.

View the keep-alive logs with:

```bash
journalctl -u render-keepalive.service -f
```

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Observability

In production applications, observability is essential for understanding how your system behaves, detecting issues early, and maintaining reliable performance.

[NestJS Observe](https://observe.nestjs.com) automatically instruments your NestJS application, giving you deep visibility into your system with minimal setup:

- **Distributed tracing:** Follow requests across services and understand how they flow through your system.
- **Waterfall analysis:** Visualize request execution and identify slow operations, bottlenecks, and unexpected delays.
- **Performance analysis:** Analyze application performance in real time and quickly pinpoint areas that need optimization.
- **Metrics:** Track key application and infrastructure metrics to understand system health and performance trends.
- **Logging:** Centralize and correlate logs with traces and other telemetry to make debugging easier.
- **Error tracking:** Detect errors quickly and investigate their root causes with the surrounding context.
- **SLA monitoring:** Track service-level objectives and identify when your application is approaching or exceeding defined thresholds.
- **Alarms and alerts:** Set up alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, SLA violations, and other anomalies so your team can react quickly.

This project is already instrumented. Create a free account at [observe.nestjs.com](https://observe.nestjs.com), add an application, and paste the generated app key and secret into the `ObserveModule.forRoot()` call in `src/app.module.ts`.

The free plan needs no payment details and covers 300,000 events a month. You can also browse the [live demo](https://www.observe-demo.nestjs.com/dashboard) first - the whole dashboard over a busy service's data, with nothing to install.
